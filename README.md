# Anonymous-Vue-App

I previously built an Anonymous Upload Manager with React.

Out of curiosity I'm using Vue now, since it's something I feel more comfortble with now.

I also had an issue with Axios and FetchNode, since both did not support "UploadProgress", and I had the idea to upload from the front end instead of the backend.

Instead of translating it from one place to another, I decided it'd be a better practice to build from scratch something that's simply better.
